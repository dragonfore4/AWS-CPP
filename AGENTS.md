# AGENTS.md

AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) study notes — Next.js static site, structured by **Stephane Maarek's Ultimate AWS Cloud Practitioner course on Udemy**.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router + TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** via npm (postcss plugin, `@import "tailwindcss"`)
- **Static export** (`output: "export"` in next.config.ts)
- Fonts: Inter + Noto Sans Thai (body), IBM Plex Serif + Noto Serif Thai (h1/h2), Geist Mono (code)
- Icons: `lucide-react` (outline, stroke 1.6–1.9)
- Language: Thai + English mixed content
- Themes: light + dark + system, switchable via popover, persisted in localStorage
- Palette: `stone` (warm neutral) base + 6 category accents (sky, rose, indigo, amber, violet, emerald)
- No backend, no API routes — pure static HTML output

## Project location

The Next.js project lives at the repository root — there is no `next-app/` subdirectory. Run all commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`) from the repo root.

## Adding a new topic

1. Create `data/topics/<slug>.ts` — export a `TopicData` object (follow existing files as template)
2. In `data/index.ts`: import the new topic and add it to the `topics` array (place it according to Stephane's section order)
3. Add a slug → category override entry in `lib/categoryAccents.ts` (`slugOverrides`) so the UI buckets the topic into the right accent group
4. Done! The navbar (both Stephane row and Category rows), homepage list, footer counts, breadcrumb, and topic page are generated automatically.

No need to touch pages, components, or the navbar — everything reads from the `topics` array.

## TopicData interface

```typescript
interface TopicData {
  slug: string;          // URL slug, e.g. "iam"
  title: string;         // Short title shown in navbar/header, e.g. "IAM"
  subtitle: string;      // Full name, e.g. "Identity and Access Management"
  /** @deprecated UI no longer reads this — accents come from category. */
  accent: string;
  category: string;      // AWS service category, e.g. "Compute", "Storage"
  description: string;   // Thai description, rendered as the lead paragraph (HTML — supports <strong>, <em>)
  keyPoints: string[];   // 3-4 bullets used to derive tags on the homepage card (HTML allowed)
  tags?: string[];       // Optional editorial tags. If omitted, derived from keyPoints[0..n].
  sections: Section[];   // Content sections
  quiz: QuizQuestion[];  // ~25 English exam questions per topic; UI samples 10 at random per session
}
```

## Content section types

Each section contains an array of content items. **All text fields render HTML** — you can use `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<br>`, `<code>`, `<span class="...">`, etc.

- `paragraph` — text (rendered with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, max-width `max-w-[68ch]`)
- `list` — bullet list with category-accent dot bullets
- `code` — code block with optional caption + accent-coloured left border (no syntax highlighting)
- `grid` — grid of `{ title, description }` cards rendered as filled boxes with `bg-elev` + `ring-1`; titles in the category accent
- `callout` — `info` (accent), `warning` (rose), `tip` (emerald) — each with a lucide icon (Info, AlertTriangle, Lightbulb) on the label

**Authoring rule — avoid pipe-separators:**
Do NOT use ` | ` to cram multiple bullet points into a single `description` or `text` field. Pipes get lost in word-wrap and become unreadable. Instead:
- Use `type: "list"` for multi-bullet content
- Use multiple `grid` items (one concept per card) instead of one card with pipe-dumps
- Use `<br>` line breaks inside a callout if you really need a short multi-line mnemonic

**`<strong>` is special inside topic articles:** the topic page tags its `<main>` with `data-strong-highlight` and inline `--shl-light` / `--shl-dark` CSS variables. Globals.css then renders every `<strong>` inside that subtree (excluding headings) with a soft marker-pen highlight in the category accent. Outside the article (navbar, footer, headings) `<strong>` stays plain bold.

## Category accent system

`lib/categoryAccents.ts` maps each of the 6 AWS categories to a literal Tailwind class set + a hex value + marker-highlight RGBA pair. UI components import `getCategoryAccent(slug, category)` and read class strings directly — JIT-safe.

The 6 categories and their accents:

| Category key | Topics | Accent |
|---|---|---|
| `compute` | ec2, elb-asg, other-compute | indigo |
| `storage` | ec2-storage, s3 | amber |
| `networking` | vpc, global-infrastructure, cloud-integration | violet |
| `database` | databases, machine-learning | emerald |
| `security` | iam, security, advanced-identity | rose |
| `management` | cloud-concepts, deployment, cloud-monitoring, account-management, other-services, well-architected, exam-tips | sky |

To change a topic's category, edit the `slugOverrides` map in `lib/categoryAccents.ts`. To recolour an entire category, edit the corresponding entry in the `accents` object (keep all token keys present so consuming components keep working).

The legacy `lib/accentClasses.ts` 18-colour map is no longer read by UI; it's kept around so the Tailwind v4 JIT scanner has prior class strings on file in case a future change wants to reintroduce them.

## Theme system

Three tokens drive the look:
- **Theme** — `light` / `dark` / `system` — written to `<html data-theme>` by `themeScript` before paint, and to localStorage by `ThemeToggle`
- **Font size** — `sm` / `md` / `lg` — class on `<body>` (`font-sm` / `font-md` / `font-lg`); server renders `font-md` so React hydrates cleanly
- **Nav layout preference** — currently both layouts render simultaneously, but the `nav_layout` localStorage key + `navLayoutScript` are still wired in for future use

`<body suppressHydrationWarning>` and `<html suppressHydrationWarning>` are set so React tolerates the inline scripts mutating attributes/classes before hydration.

## Navbar

`components/Navbar.tsx` is a server component composed of three rows + an optional breadcrumb:

1. **Sticky brand strip** — logo "AWS CLF-C02 บันทึกย่อ" (no emoji) + `<SettingsPopover>` (theme + font-size). Only this row is sticky.
2. **`<StephaneNavRow>`** under a `ตามคอร์ส` label — every topic in course order, with a `01 02 ...` mono prefix.
3. **`<CategoryNavRows>`** under a `ตามหมวด` label — six rows, one per AWS category, each with a fixed-width label column + flex-wrapped topic chips.
4. **Breadcrumb** (topic pages only) — `Topics › Category › 03 EC2` with a chevron between segments.

Active topic styling in both layouts: `font-semibold` + accent text + accent tint background + accent ring. Inactive topics use muted ink with a hover swap.

## Quiz format

Each topic has a **pool of ~25 English-language CLF-C02 exam-style questions** stored in the `quiz` array of its `data/topics/<slug>.ts` file. The UI samples **10 questions at random** from the pool per session — every visit and every retry produces a different subset.

- **Pool size** — 25–26 questions per topic (501 total across the 20 topics)
- **Session size** — 10 random questions, drawn fresh on mount and on retry
- **Language** — questions, options, and explanations are all in **English** (the topic article body content remains Thai)
- **Question shape** — 4 options (A/B/C/D), `correct` is the 0-based index of the right answer, `explanation` is shown after the user picks. All text fields support HTML (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<code>`, `<br>`, etc.)
- **Interactive flow** — one question at a time; clicking an option locks in the answer, reveals the explanation, and advances to the next on the user's click. The final score is saved to localStorage per slug under the key `quiz_progress_<slug>`.
- **Retry** — bumps a `retryToken` state which forces `useMemo` to re-shuffle the pool. The previous-result panel is hidden until the new session completes (even though the old score still lives in localStorage until the new one overwrites it).
- **Print** — `<QuizPrintBlock>` is a server component that renders the **entire pool** of questions + answers + explanations, hidden on screen via `hidden print:block` and revealed only when printing. Useful for offline study.

### Hydration-safe randomization

Because the site is statically exported, every topic page is server-rendered at build time. The quiz randomization must NOT cause a server/client HTML mismatch on hydration. `QuizSection.tsx` solves this with `useSyncExternalStore`:

```tsx
// True after mount on the client; false during SSR + first client paint.
const isMounted = useSyncExternalStore(
  subscribeNoop,
  () => true,    // client snapshot
  () => false,   // server snapshot
);

// Saved progress: null during SSR, populated from localStorage after mount.
// Subscribes to 'quiz-progress-change' + 'storage' for live updates.
const previousProgress = useSyncExternalStore<QuizProgress | null>(
  subscribeProgress,
  () => readProgress(slug),
  () => null,
);

const activeQuestions = useMemo(() => {
  if (!isMounted) return deterministicSample(questions, 10);  // first 10
  return sampleQuestions(questions, 10);                       // random 10
}, [isMounted, questions, retryToken]);
```

Why it works:

1. SSR + first client render → `isMounted=false` → both produce `questions.slice(0, 10)` → byte-identical HTML, no mismatch.
2. After hydration commits, `useSyncExternalStore` re-reads → `isMounted=true` → `useMemo` re-runs with `Math.random()` → swaps in a fresh shuffle.
3. Retry button bumps `retryToken` → `useMemo` re-runs → fresh shuffle.

Two project-wide lint rules influence this design:

- `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` — disallows `setState` calls inside `useEffect` for client-only initialization. We use derived state (`useMemo` + `useSyncExternalStore`) instead.
- `react-hooks/refs` — disallows reading `ref.current` during render. We use `useState` + `useMemo` instead of caching the shuffle in a `useRef`.

This pattern (mounted boolean via `useSyncExternalStore`) is the canonical way to gate any client-only / non-deterministic / browser-API-dependent rendering in this codebase. The same pattern is used by `HomepageProgress.tsx` for reading saved scores.

### Authoring more questions

Open `data/topics/<slug>.ts`, find the `quiz: [...]` array near the bottom, and append more `QuizQuestion` objects. IDs follow `<slug>-q<n>` (e.g. `iam-q27`). Keep questions in English so they're consistent with the existing pool. Sources used historically: AWS sample questions, exam guides, and reputable CLF-C02 prep material — not copy-pasted verbatim.

After editing, run `npm run lint && npm run build` to verify the static export still emits cleanly (24 pages: 1 home + 20 topics + 3 system).

## Content currency policy

This project's content was audited end-to-end on **2026-05-30** against AWS Official Documentation and the CLF-C02 Exam Guide. The full report — including the line-by-line list of every quiz and article-body change made, plus the methodology used — lives at **[`AUDIT.md`](./AUDIT.md)** at the repo root.

**Before modifying any topic file (article body or quiz), read `AUDIT.md` first** so you don't reintroduce issues that were just removed. The audit covered all 501 quiz questions and ~16,000 lines of article body across 20 topic files; ~142 edits were applied.

### Discontinued services — DO NOT REINTRODUCE

These AWS services have been removed from the content because they are no longer sold or supported. Do not add them back as quiz options or article content. If a CLF-C02 exam study resource still references them (older Stephane lectures, third-party prep books), prefer the current AWS reality.

| Service | Status as of May 2026 |
|---|---|
| AWS CodeStar | Discontinued 2024-07-31 (product page redirects) |
| AWS Snowmobile | Discontinued 2024 (product page redirects to Snowball) |
| Amazon WorkDocs | Discontinued 2025-03-31 |
| Amazon Lookout for Metrics | Discontinued (product page redirects) |
| Amazon Lookout for Vision | Discontinued (product page redirects) |
| AWS RoboMaker | Closed to new customers Sep 2022 |
| AWS DeepLens | Discontinued 2024 |
| Amazon Chime end-user app | End of support 2026-02-20 — **Chime SDK is still active and OK to reference** |
| Amazon Lookout for Equipment | End of support 2026-10-07 — avoid in new content |

### Renamed services — use current names

When writing quiz options or article body, use the current AWS service name. The audit standardised on these names; on a first reference you may use `(formerly X)` to help exam takers, but subsequent references should use the current name only.

| Old name | Current name |
|---|---|
| Kinesis Data Firehose | Amazon Data Firehose |
| Kinesis Data Analytics | Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink |
| AWS SSO / AWS Single Sign-On | AWS IAM Identity Center |
| Amazon CodeWhisperer | Amazon Q Developer |
| AWS Personal Health Dashboard | AWS Health Dashboard |
| AWS Fault Injection Simulator | AWS Fault Injection Service |
| Amazon WorkSpaces Web | Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser |
| AWS CodeStar Connections | AWS CodeConnections |
| Amazon Elasticsearch Service | Amazon OpenSearch Service |
| Inspector Agent (v1) | AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent — Inspector v2 since 2021 |

### Partial-EoL — keep with disclaimer

These services still exist but have known limitations. Mention the caveat near their primary description (typically a `callout` of variant `warning`):

| Service | Caveat |
|---|---|
| AWS Cloud9 | Closed to new customers since July 2024 — existing users may continue |
| Amazon Forecast | Still active; AWS now also recommends **SageMaker Canvas** for new forecasting workloads |
| AWS CodeCommit | Returned to **full GA on 2025-11-24** — do **not** add the old "closed to new customers" disclaimer |

### Authoring rules from the audit

- **No pipe-separator violations.** Never use ` | ` to cram multiple bullet points into a single `description:` or `text:` field. Use `type: "list"` for multi-bullet content, multiple `grid` items for multi-concept rows, or `<br>` inside a callout for short multi-line mnemonics. ASCII tables inside `code:` blocks are exempt — those use ` | ` legitimately as table separators.
- **Use stable phrasing for numeric facts that AWS revises frequently.** Prefer `"hundreds of edge locations (600+)"` over `"216+"` so the content stays correct through the next AWS expansion. Specific numbers are OK when they're stable (e.g. Lambda max execution = 15 minutes, S3 max object = 5 TB, Aurora storage auto-scales to 128 TiB).
- **No emoji** in user-facing content. Use `lucide-react` icons via `<CategoryIcon>` for visual cues. The legacy `emoji` field on `TopicData` was removed in the May 2026 audit.
- **No agent-comment leakage.** Never write meta-commentary like `"Stephane updates AGENTS.md"`, `"TODO"`, or `"FIXME"` into a quiz `explanation` or article `text`. The audit removed one such leak from `deployment.ts` quiz q3.

### Reference sources (in priority order)

When checking currency or adding new content, consult these sources in order:

1. **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Exam Guide** — https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/ (defines exam scope and domain weighting: Cloud Concepts 24%, Security 30%, Cloud Technology 34%, Billing/Pricing/Support 12%)
2. **AWS official service pages** — `https://aws.amazon.com/<service>/` for each service. A 404 or redirect to homepage typically signals a discontinued service.
3. **AWS What's New** — https://aws.amazon.com/new/ — for recent launches, renames, and EoL announcements
4. **AWS DevOps / News blogs** — for service-status announcements like *"The Future of AWS CodeCommit"* (2025-11-24 GA return)
5. **Stephane Maarek's Udemy course** — used as the structural baseline (topic order, sections), but **always verify currency against AWS sources first**; if course material disagrees with current AWS reality, follow AWS

### Re-running the audit

If a year passes, or after a major AWS re:Invent announcement, refresh the audit:

1. Read the methodology and category breakdown in `AUDIT.md`
2. Sweep each topic file against the latest AWS documentation using the same 6 categories (discontinued, partial-EoL, renaming, outdated numbers, format, quiz consistency)
3. Update `AUDIT.md` with new findings and a new "วันที่ตรวจ" date
4. Update the tables in this section if new services are discontinued / renamed / EoL'd

## Build & verification

Run all commands from the repository root:

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint check (must pass with 0 errors)
npm run build         # TypeScript compile + static export to out/
npm run dev           # Dev server at localhost:3000
```

Verify:
- `npm run build` completes without errors and emits 24 static pages (homepage + 20 topic pages + 3 system pages)
- All 20 topic pages render at `/topics/<slug>`
- Navbar shows both Stephane-order row and Category-grouped rows on every page; the active topic is highlighted in both
- HTML tags inside content (e.g., `<strong>`) render properly — they should NOT appear as literal text
- Inside topic articles, `<strong>` shows a soft marker-pen highlight in the topic's category accent (light + dark)
- Quiz is interactive (click answers, see explanation, score saves to localStorage); each visit / retry shows a different random 10-question subset drawn from the topic's full pool of ~25 questions, with no hydration warnings in the browser console
- Theme toggle (Light / Dark / System) and font-size toggle (S / M / L) both persist across reloads with no FOUC and no hydration warnings
- Reading progress bar tints to the topic's category accent
- Print preview hides nav/footer/TOC/settings, forces light theme, and reveals every quiz question + its answer + explanation

## Tailwind v4 — CSS-variable arbitrary values

When referencing CSS custom properties from utility classes use the **`var(...)`** form, not bare double-dashes:

- ✅ `bg-[var(--bg-elev)]`, `text-[var(--ink)]`, `border-[var(--rule)]`
- ❌ `bg-[--bg-elev]` — Tailwind v4 emits `background-color: --bg-elev` which is not a valid CSS value, so the property silently fails

The custom dark variant is declared as `@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme="dark"] *, [data-theme="dark"]))` in `globals.css`, which lets `dark:` prefixes target the manual theme attribute set by JS instead of the OS preference.

## Design principles

- **Editorial restraint** — no emoji, no gradients, no decorative shadows; chrome stays neutral and accents do real work (heading colour, strong-highlight, list bullets, callout label, code-block edge, reading-progress bar)
- **Readability first** — body 17px (`1.0625rem`), line-height `1.7`, slight letter-spacing for Thai legibility, `text-wrap: pretty` on body and `text-wrap: balance` on headings
- **Adaptive width** — paragraph/list/callout content sits inside `max-w-[68ch]`; grid spans the full article column and uses 3 columns on lg when ≥6 items
- **Easy on the eyes** — `stone` palette base (warm neutral), six low-saturation category accents (sky, rose, indigo, amber, violet, emerald), italic disabled (Thai italic is poorly designed everywhere) and replaced with dotted underline on `<em>` to denote "term being defined"
- **Thai-friendly** — `Noto Sans Thai` next to Inter, antialiased + `optimizeLegibility`; `Noto Serif Thai` paired with IBM Plex Serif for headings
- **Stephane-aligned** — topic order, structure, and exam tips track Stephane Maarek's Udemy course one-to-one
- **Static-first** — no SSR, no API routes, deployable as plain HTML/CSS/JS
